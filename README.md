## Description
A blog website where you can post about whatever honestly, but keep it pg please or you will be banned.

## Usage
```
When a user(you) opens the site the are greeted with a landing page.
Then you can choose to login or register
If you choose register, you are redirected to the register page.
Then you must sign up with an email, username, and password(You won't be able to get in otherwise).
Then if registration is successfull they are taken to their dashboard.
Where you can see your username and all of your posts.
Then you can choose to read the post by clicking on the title where you will be then taken to that post's screen.
On the post's screen you can see the post details, read the posts, and make a comment below the post.
You can edit the post by clicking on the edit post button where you will be then taken to that post's edit screen.
On the edit screen you will see the post details, and be able to change the title and content of the post should you choose to do so.
When you click on the submit you will then be taken back to your dashboard page.
Back on the dashboard you can also delete the post with the delete post button. Be wary your post will be gone forever and all of it's comments as well.
So choose wisely.
On the dashboard page you can click on the homepage link and you will be redirected to the home page where you will see everyone's posts
You will also see a preview of the post to see if it cacthes your interest and when you hit the continue reading you will then be taken to that post's page.
Similar to how clicking the post title on the dashboard works, so you have two ways to get to that particular post's page.
There's also cool hover styles on the buttons and a cool underline animation on the nav links.
That's pretty much it, hope I'm not forgetting anything.

## Future Development
```
I'm pretty happy with how this site turned out. I may continue to work on it.
Add a like and dislike(maybe not lol) buttons would be cool, so people can see how much interest is in the blog post.
Add a saved posts where the user can click on a button that will save a post and show on their saved posts screen.
Add better responsiveness, although i try to design my websites mobile first, so i tend to keep everything towards the middle of the screen.
Anything else I can think of will be added.
